# gene-variant-annotator
This repository contains a bioinformatics pipeline for annotating genetic variants from VCF files using Snakemake. It provides gene, dbSNP IDs, and population frequency annotations. The project also includes a Flask-based web interface to filter variants by frequency and depth (DP), with Docker support for easy setup.
